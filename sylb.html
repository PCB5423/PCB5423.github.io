<h4><strong>Course description and learning outcome:</strong></h4>
<p>This workshop is connected to PCB5423 course, and it will be a
co-requisite and will be offered to students enrolled in this course.
The workshop is designed to provide an active learning experience by
analyzing and illustrating several of the topics that will be discussed
in PCB5423 by using ecological models and analytical tools.
Specifically, R programming language will be used to learn and implement
ecological models and analytical tools and discuss ecological
fundamentals using quantitative examples. R is becoming one of the most
used programming platforms to analyze and illustrate ecological
patterns/data; thus, we hope to introduce novice and beginner coders to
this fantastic programming language.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-and-where" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>When and where:</strong></h4>
<p><em>In-Person Sessions:</em> Lectures and hands-on
programming/modeling exercises will be an integral part of the
workshop’s learning experience; thus, most sessions will be based on
face-to-face meetings to facilitate learning and assistance during the
workshop sessions. In-person sessions will be offered only at BBC.</p>
<p><em>Remote Lectures:</em> I will use Zoom to teach remotely if our
face-to-face class cannot meet as regularly scheduled. I will contact
you using CANVAS and email about Zoom link details. Also, I will use
Zoom for remote lectures during days I expect to be out of town for
fieldwork or meetings. I will announce any changes to the schedule one
week or more in advance.</p>
<p><em>Office hours:</em> Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:00 – 4:00 pm, or by
appointment. Please request a Zoom link by email or pass by my office
for office hours meetings. I am constantly in/out of my office since my
lab spaces are not in MSB; thus, please send me an email or talk to me
after the workshop lectures to set up a meeting at my office.</p>
</div>
<div id="teaching-schedule" class="section level4">

<p>Changes to this schedule and other announcements regarding the course

<div id="teaching" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Teaching:</strong></h4>
<p>A lectures and R programming exercises will be part of each workshop
session to introduce several topics on population and community modeling
and analyses and provide context to the ecological fundamentals taught
in PCB5423. The grade will be based on participation, homework
exercises, and final project (see below).</p>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Grading:</strong></h4>
<p>The final grade will be composed of 3 assignments/tasks. These three
assignments/tasks are: 1) Class participation (attendance and class
exercises), 2) R exercises homework, 3) R Project.</p>
<p><strong>Class participation (Total 10 pts)</strong> will count for
20% of your final grade. This grade will consist of attending class (0,
1) and participating in class discussions and exercises (0, 1). Class
discussion includes asking and answering questions, insightful comments
and suggestions, and helping peers.</p>
<p><strong>R homework exercises (Total 50 pts – 25 pts/hw)</strong> will
count for 40% of your grade. After several R “lab”/workshop sessions,
students will turn in an assignment showing proof that they ran some of
the code in R and understood the outputs of the models. The
programming/coding aspect of the homework can be completed as a
collective effort of student teams; however, students should
independently answer and submit the homework questions. Please, submit
homework answers as pdf or word document and the R files showing the
code used to answer the questions.</p>
<p><strong>R project (Total 50 pts)</strong> will count for 40% of your
final grade. Groups will be formed with 2-3 students, and each group
will submit a report showing a population and/or community-based
modeling/analysis approach applied to a selected ecological dataset or
simulated data. The modeling or analysis idea should be derived from a
research question inspired by any topics discussed in class and the
workshop sessions. The report should not be longer than five pages.
Within five pages limit, students should include an introduction section
that lays out background information that sustains or contextualize the
research question, a methods section with details on the dataset and
modeling technique/analyses used, and results/discussion section that
summarizes and explains the main results. The grade will consist of the
introduction presentation (10 pts), the final report (35), and R code
file (5 pts).</p>
</div>
<div id="rubric" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Rubric: </strong></h4>
<p>Grade scale is: A: 100-90; B: 89-80; C: &lt;79. This is a
graduate-level workshop; thus, if you are taking this course is because
you have a genuine interest in ecological learning and developing your
academic career. For this reason, I think final grades should be pass (A
or B) or no pass (C). I will be somewhat lenient to allow for critical
thinking, creativeness, and thoughtfulness. Whether you receive an A or
B will depend on how well you do in the final report and how often you
attend class and participate. I will give students a C (or less) who
didn’t commit to the work.</p>
<p>Students will be graded on their performance in the above areas ONLY.
Future career plans will have ZERO influence on the grade you receive in
this class. Incomplete grades will be considered only under
extraordinary circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div id="make-up-policy" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Make-up policy: </strong></h4>
<p>I will provide make-up opportunities only when students present valid
excuses (e.g., medical/family emergencies, COVID-19 related emergency
and precaution, major fieldwork trips, or conferences). Regardless of
the reason, please contact me to identify alternative methods for
completing course requirements, depending on the type of assignment
missed and the severity of missed assignments. Below is a guideline of
potential make-up scenarios/methods (Subject to change): -
<em>Participation</em> – Due to the limited number of sessions, I will
provide a participation point for only one missed session with a
validated and accepted excuse. - <em>Homework</em> – Make-up
alternatives only for medical (including COVID-19) emergencies. The
make-up will consist of submitting the homework materials at a later
date (e.g., 48-72 hours after the submission deadline), depending on the
gravity of the emergency.<br />
- <em>R project</em> - No make-up alternatives for this assignment. An
incomplete final grade will be submitted if, for some acceptable
reason/excuse, a student can’t finish and submit the R project
report.</p>

<div id="professional-and-academic-integrity" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Professional and academic integrity:</strong></h4>
<p>Students are encouraged to employ critical thinking and rely on data
and verifiable sources to interrogate all assigned readings and subject
matter in this course as a way of determining whether they agree with
their classmates and/or their instructor. No lesson is intended to
espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling,
perception, viewpoint, or belief.</p>
<p>FIU is a community dedicated to generating and imparting knowledge
through excellent teaching and research, the rigorous and respectful
exchange of ideas, and community service. All students should respect
others’ right to have an equitable opportunity to learn and honestly
demonstrate the quality of their learning. Therefore, all students are
expected to adhere to a standard of academic conduct, which demonstrates
respect for themselves, their fellow students, and the University’s
educational mission. The University deems all students to understand
that if they are found responsible for academic misconduct (e.g.,
cheating, plagiarism, academic dishonesty), they will be subject to the
Academic Misconduct procedures and sanctions, as outlined in the Student
Handbook.</p>
</div>
<div id="honesty-code-statement" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Honesty Code Statement:</strong></h4>
<p>FIU defines academic misconduct in the Student Conduct and Honor Code
(Code) as “any act or omission by a Student, which violates the concept
of academic integrity and undermines the academic mission of the
University in violation of the Code.” Code violations include, but are
not limited to: academic dishonesty, bribery, cheating, commercial use,
complicity, falsification, and plagiarism. The Code is available here:
